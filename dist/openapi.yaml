    [Changelog](https://github.com/IsThereAnyDeal/API/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

    IsThereAnyDeal API provides programmatic access to features found at IsThereAnyDeal.  

    ## Terms of Service

    API is provided in good faith. We trust you won't misuse the API to damage IsThereAnyDeal, its users or its reputation.

    - You MAY use this API for commercial purposes **IF** the resulting app is available to public. If you want to use this API privately contact us.
    - You SHOULD provide a link to IsThereAnyDeal.com or mention IsThereAnyDeal API.
    - You MUST NOT make an impression that you are affiliated with IsThereAnyDeal, unless agreed otherwise.
      If you are interested in making an official app, please contact us.
    - You MUST NOT change provided data in any way. This means that you can't remove affiliate tags from the URLs, change prices and so on.
      You MAY use only part of data provided and enrich them from your own sources.  
    - You MUST NOT make an app that could be considered a competition to IsThereAnyDeal or IsThereAnyDeal projects.
    - You MUST NOT use this API to directly or indirectly help the competition of IsThereAnyDeal.

    All data are provided _as-is_. We reserve the right to deny you access to the API at any point without notice.
    If you are not sure about any of the points, please contact us.

    ## Access

    Most of the endpoints will be restricted by either API key or OAuth.
    In order to get neccessary keys, you have to [register your app](https://isthereanydeal.com/apps/my/).
    Upon registration, api keys and OAuth credentials will be generated for you.

    For some endpoints you might need explicit approval for use. In such cases, contact us.

    ### OAuth

    We support [authorization code](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/) flow with [PKCE extension](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/).

    > You can find PKCE step-through tutorial at [OAuth 2.0 PKCE Flow](https://www.oauth.com/playground/authorization-code-with-pkce.html)

    Do not set hard limits for token lengths. Server will return access token as JWT of variable length.
    To authorize your endpoint access use Authorization header.

    > At the moment implicit flow is also enabled, but its usage is discouraged and support may be removed in the future

    ## Rate Limiting

    Access to API is rate limited and subject to change. You should get rate-limit info in appropriate headers.
    Further limits and restrictions may be added if we detect misuse. 

    If you have questions about limits, contact us.

    # Unstable and Internal Endpoints

    Some endpoints are marked as unstable or internal. Unstable endpoints are publicly available,
    but the API may not be completely finalized yet - either the way the endpoint is called or the response may change
    at any time.

    Internal APIs are available only for our own services. They are documented here for the sake of completeness.

    # Unofficial SDKs
    - [isthereanydeal-nodejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isthereanydeal-nodejs) \
      An unofficial Node.js library for the IsThereAnyDeal API written in TypeScript.

      Endpoints for looking up things on IsThereAnyDeal.

      Endpoints in `/lookup/` namespace will follow this URL structure: `/lookup/{lookup-what}/{by-what}/`

      Endpoints from other namespaces that are related to lookup in any way may also be
      included in this category.

    description: |
      You can create a link between your app's users' accounts and ITAD, and use that link to sync
      games into Waitlist and Collection in the similar fashion as natively supported profiles on IsThereAnyDeal.
  - name: Sync
    description: |
      Sync endpoints provide easier way to add or remove games from Waitlist and Collection.

      Sync via API works in the same way as natively supported sync of remote profiles, but instead of ITAD pulling data,
      you will have to push data. Behavior of sync'd games is the same as for natively supported profiles.

      It is useful when you can create a list of all games for user, and don't want to handle game identification,
      deduplication, additions and removals via regular API endpoints.

  - name: Webhooks
    description: |
      Webhooks provide a simpler wait to get data from IsThereAnyDeal, if you don't required full API access.

      User can [register a webhook in their settings](https://isthereanydeal.com/settings/webhooks/)
      and choose which events they wish to listen to. Once the event is triggered on IsThereAnyDeal,
      a request will be sent to registered webhook.

      Each request will include `ITAD-Hook-ID` header with a unique ID of a registered webhook
      and `ITAD-Event-ID` headers which identify the event.

        Update one or more categories.

        For each category that you are going to update, only `id` is required. Fields that you do not want to update may be
        set to `null` or omitted fully. Categories that do not exist or user does not own will be ignored.

        Default category (id: `0`) may have only `public` property updated. Other properties will be ignored.

        This operation is atomic, either all categories update or none. Successful response is the full category list,
        including categories that were not updated.

        Profile is an object identifying remote account. You need linked profile to use sync endpoints.

        After successful link you will get profile token, which is used in subsequent profile operations,
        usually as an `ITAD-Profile` header. 

        Linking is idempotent, if you lose your token, or you need it in different instance of your app,
        you can link the same profile again.
