  summary: Link profile
  description: |
    Profile is an object identifying remote account. You need linked profile to use sync endpoints.
    
    After successful link you will get profile token, which is used in subsequent profile operations,
    usually as an `ITAD-Profile` header. 
    
    Linking is idempotent, if you lose your token, or you need it in different instance of your app,
    you can link the same profile again.
