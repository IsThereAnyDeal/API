      ID can be any string that will identify the game. It should be stable and not change in the future.
      
      ID can also used to identify the game, if you use same IDs that we use for tracking shops. If a game is not identified
      with shop and id, we will use title. 
      
      For Steam we use full ids, i.e. app/{id}, sub/{id} or bundle/{id}.
  title:
